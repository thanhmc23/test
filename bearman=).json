  "passage": "It’s Haas rookie Ollie Bearman’s turn to face our Getting to Know quickfire questions as we head into the summer break. From amusing driving test tales to the F1 legends he would bring to a dinner party, and the person who last made him cry with laughter to the sports he is keen to master, the Briton reveals all in the video player above and transcript below…\n\nCan you describe yourself in three words?\n\nFast – I hope! Determined. And kind.\n\nWhat made you fall in love with F1?\n\nI remember before I started karting, before anything, I would go to some of my dad’s [David] races. He was racing at club level in the UK. The smell of the rubber and the fuel, I fell in love with it straight away. I knew this was what I wanted to do.\n\nWhat level did your dad get to in racing?\n\nHe was racing like sportscars in the UK. Nothing crazy. Unfortunately, he couldn’t afford to really do anything more. That was when I was maybe five or six years old. I remember going there with my mum, and my mum would get so stressed watching him! But I loved the sound, the smell and the speed of the cars. That was really the beginning for me.\n\nBAHRAIN, BAHRAIN - FEBRUARY 26: Oliver Bearman of Great Britain and Haas F1 looks on during day one\nBearman is contesting his first full F1 season at Haas in 2025, teaming up with Esteban Ocon\nWhen and where did you first drive something?\n\nSo, the first time I drove… I think… you’ll have to fact-check with my parents who were actually there! I was six years old… and it was at Buckmore Park. I was just learning how to go and stop in a circle and this guy kept crashing into the back of me – that’s the only thing I remember from that day! I learnt how to stop, but the guy behind me certainly didn’t… he was using my bumper as a brake.\n\nThere’s a lot of competition with this question… How many times did it take you to pass your driving test?\n\nI didn’t pass my driving test the first time. Basically, what happened was… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, but you know those stop signs? You have to stop at them… and still to this day I say that I stopped, but the instructor seemed to think that I was creeping, so I failed. The road was downhill and then it stopped, and I was creeping. Then the other thing, because I failed it on two things, you know those hatch lines that you can’t drive into? Well, it turns out you can drive into them if you’re turning right, and that was a very specific rule that I didn’t know, because I thought I was too good to have any driving lessons! I went straight in for the test.\n\nJEDDAH, SAUDI ARABIA - MARCH 09: Oliver Bearman of Great Britain and Ferrari prepares arrives on\nHe announced himself to the F1 paddock with a spectacular stand-in debut at the 2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix\nBut you passed at the second attempt?\n\nSecond time I passed, of course, but that was a very embarrassing story.\n\nWhen was the last time you cried with laughter?\n\nLet me think… one I remember that was really funny… I laugh a lot I guess! When I was at home a few weeks ago, I was having breakfast with my family and my brother [Thomas] said something so funny that I was literally crying. Sometimes when I start laughing I really can’t stop and that was one of those moments.\n\nCereal going everywhere?\n\nNo, it was… he didn’t spill anything, but my brother sometimes comes out with some amazing jokes that he doesn’t even realise, and that’s why it’s doubly funny.\n\nWho’s your best friend inside the F1 paddock? You’re going to upset someone with this answer...\n\n(Laughs). I would say Gabi Bortoleto. We live very close [to each other], we see each other a lot and spend a lot of time together. He’s a great guy. We fight on track and laugh off the track as well.\n\nbortoleto-bearman-2025-1.png\nBearman and fellow rookie Bortoleto have a strong friendship off the track\nYou’ll be pleased to know that Gabi said you as well…\n\nReally? Ahh.\n\nYou and Max Verstappen…\n\nI’ll take that! That’s good.\n\nWhich three F1 personalities past or present would you invite to a dinner party and why?\n\nProbably Ayrton Senna. He’s someone that I really look up to. I’m sad to have never been able to watch any of his races. Michael Schumacher as well. His success at Ferrari looked incredible, and his work ethic and passion for the sport is admirable. I would say Lewis Hamilton, but I can speak to him sometimes as well if I want, so I would go back to the very beginning and say someone like [Giuseppe] Farina. Someone from the very, very start, just to see what they went through.\n\nWhat’s the best holiday you’ve been on?\n\nWell, I haven’t been on it yet, but at the end of the year I’m going to the Maldives, so I think that will be the best. Until then, I would say last year, at the end of the year, when I went to Japan for a few days. It was just me, my mum and my girlfriend, and it was really, really fun. It was freezing cold, but it was so fun – we had a blast!\n\n\nPlay Video\n2025 Rookie Roundtable with Kimi, Jack, Ollie, Isack and Gabriel\n\nThe Maldives sound great as well…\n\nYeah, it sounds a bit warmer!\n\nWhat would your karaoke song be? I don’t know if that’s a thing at Haas…\n\nOh… I guess Livin’ on a Prayer by Bon Jovi.\n\nWhat’s your favourite film and TV show of all time? I imagine you get some time to watch things on flights…\n\nYeah, exactly, I do watch a lot. Favourite film? F1 The Movie…\n\nVery good, very good…\n\nI would say I really like Top Gun, and The Shawshank Redemption is a great film as well. Not more that I can think of right now. At the moment I’m watching Suits for like the third time. I also really enjoyed Breaking Bad and Prison Break. Those are three great series.\n\nhaas-bon-jovi-2025-1.png\nBearman met American rock legend Jon Bon Jovi at this year’s Miami Grand Prix\nWhat’s the strangest gift you’ve ever been given by a fan?\n\nThe first time I got a teddy bear I was a bit confused, then I realised it’s because of my surname. I wouldn’t say strange. My fans are incredibly thoughtful and kind, and they always give great gifts. I have a big collection at home!\n\nYou keep a lot of them then?\n\nYeah. I give away the teddy bears, so I’m very popular with the family!\n\nWhat’s the best advice you’ve ever received?\n\nLefty loosey, righty tighty. Like tightening bolts, it’s always important to do the right one…\n\nSimple but effective…\n\nExactly!\n\nWhich other job do you wish you could try for a day?\n\nYou know, I wish I could be a football player. I wish I could kick a football! That sounds incredible. Or a cyclist. I try to cycle but I’m not good enough. One day, I wish I’ll have the power to cycle like a professional and make them suffer. Now, when I cycle with good cyclists I’m dying and they’re talking to me like they’re sitting down, and it’s really embarrassing. I want to flip that and be a great cyclist. I would be a cyclist.\n\nbearman-gift-2025-1.png\nBearman has already picked up plenty of gifts on his trips around the world\nWhat’s your proudest moment in F1 so far? I remember interviewing you over the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix weekend in 2024 – that amazing Ferrari debut. I imagine it’s toward the top of the list, but you’ve had some special moments…\n\nYeah, there’ve been some standout moments. I was really happy with Saudi, of course. But this year we’ve had a few good races. Bahrain was a great one where I was fighting from the back and managed to score points. There’ve also been a few races where I felt like I performed really well but didn’t quite have everything to show for it – Monaco was an example of that. Also Imola… these are races where I felt like I’ve been driving really well with nothing to show for it. Saudi is definitely my best moment so far, but hopefully there’s something that goes above that.\n\nA lovely radio message from your dad at the end of the race in Bahrain as well…\n\nYeah! I don’t know why he spoke on the radio, but he did. It was nice!\n\nWhere do you want to be in five years’ time?\n\nHonestly, I hope fighting for a World Championship. I hope that I can prove that I deserve to belong here, be with a top team, really give everything and show what I’m made of. That’s my goal for the next five years!\n\nSounds like a good plan…\n\nThank you!",
